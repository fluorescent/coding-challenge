### Takeaways

- I tried to get as close as possible to the design style, but there are still small differences in details.

- I am aware of using inline style in React is not the best practice. I tried to complete this project in a limited time and with as little use of libraries as possible. Generally I would use StyledComponents or Emotion so the code would be less messy.

- Because of time constraints, I did not do much optimization, such as adjusting the size of the image, etc.
