# Fluorescent Coding Challenge

Hello! Thank you for your interest in working at Fluorescent. This is a small take-home challenge that should take 2-3 hours. Use any stack that you're comfortable with. Please create a new github repo, so we can see your work. Submissions can be made by sending a link of your finished repo to us. 

## Overview

Develop a small piece of a theme product page. The design comps can be found [here](https://www.figma.com/file/FlhgDlLpSEIHWowdftmJlW/Dev-challenge-(Copy)?type=design&node-id=0%3A1&t=3NSfJnjo6SuJiMyv-1).


## Requirements

* Recreate the design in the comps with all assets provided (fonts will be sent with the link to these intsructions)
* Host your page somewhere

## Stretch goals
* Make the page responsive. You have not been given mobile designs, use your best judgement (priority over other stretch goals)
* Clicking a thumbnail will update the main product image and the active thumbnail state

## Time Constraint

Please do not spend more than three hours on this. We're not judging whether you've made it perfect â€” we're looking for how well you follow instructions.

## Final product

We're detail oriented folks here at Fluorescent. 

Please include a brief write up in your repos `README.md` about the stack you chose and decisions you made.
